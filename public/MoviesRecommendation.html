 <h1>THE BEST MUCH WATCH MOVIES ACCORDING TO KARAN </h1>
<h2>MY TOP THREE MOVIES OF ALL TIME..</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>We all need hope everyday here and there to just get along with life..<br/>
Without it I don't think we can last even a day.This movies tells us beautifully how hope can take a man so far in life even when all the circumstances in life are against him/her.<br/>
P.S:YOU DEFINITELY CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS THIS MASTERPIECE!! </p>
<h3>All Quiet On The Western Front</h3>
<p>This movies carry a strong anti-war theme and shows how the war affects both the parties.<br/>
Based on the novel of the same name,this movie shows the physical and mental trauma that was faced by the soldiers of both the axis and allies in the Second World War.<br/>
It mainly focuses on the troops of the German side as they are widely acknowledged for notorious war crimes..<br/>
This movie also shows how the Ministers and Bureaucrats enjoy all the power while the poor soldiers draped with Nationalism went to borders to fight..<br/>
P.S:IT HAS ALSO WON THE ACADEMY AWARD IN THE CATEGORY OF FOREIGN FILM..</p>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>A Movie which tells us that while money is an important aspect of life , we should never trade our passion for it..<br/>
Doing work which we don't like will never ever give us satisfaction even if we are getting good amount of money for it..<br/>
After all we are not here to just merely act like a money making machine,we are here to enjoy every second of life!!<br/>
P.S:MOMENTS LIVED ARE THE REAL TREASURE OF LIFE..</p>
